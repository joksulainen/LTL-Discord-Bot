# Last To Leave Discord Bot

A Discord bot designed around the game of Last to leave using the py-cord python library.

This repository is not being actively maintained and is largely a hobby project for whenever I feel like working on it.
I won't be upset if people choose to fork and continue work without me whether it be for themselves or to contribute.


## How to contribute or continue work

1. Install Python 3.11 and pipenv package via pip. Not much needs to be said here.
1. Install project dependencies using `pipenv install` in project directory.
1. Off you go to contribute or whatever it is that you will do.
