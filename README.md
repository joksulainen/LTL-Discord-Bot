# Last To Leave Discord Bot

A Discord bot designed around the game of Last to leave using the py-cord Python library.

This repository is not being actively maintained and is largely a hobby project for whenever I feel like working on it.
I won't be upset if people choose to fork and continue work without me whether it be for themselves or to contribute.

## DISCLAIMER

This project is not produciton ready and should not be used.

## How to use

1. Install Python 3.13 and/or uv through your preferred method.
1. Install program dependencies.
    - uv:
        - Run `uv sync` in project root.
    - requirements.txt:
        - Run `pip install -r ./requirements.txt` in project root, preferably inside a venv to not bloat the system install.
1. Run `main.py` once.
1. Open `config.json` and fill `token` and `guild_id` fields.
1. Run `main.py` again.

## How to contribute or continue work

1. Install Python 3.13 and uv through your preferred method. Not much needs to be said here.
